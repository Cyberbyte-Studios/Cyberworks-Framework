## Translating
We have added many new strigns to our language files and would loke other developers to add to them before our release, editing is very simple and works like below:
    
    $lang['edit'] = 'Edit';
    
This would be the English file and to translate into German all you need to do is change the words at the end so it becomes.
    
    $lang['edit'] = 'bearbeiten'; (Ignore my german I failed it)
    
We know there are lots of strings but are greatful that people what to give up there time to help us with this, if you need any help you can email cyberworks@cyberbyte.com or PM a developer on the Altis Life RPG forums.
