# Cyberworks Framework
Although the Framework is still under construction we will slowly be releasing developer tools and documentation.
You can sign up for our mailing list at http://eepurl.com/brit7P.

## Translating
We have added many new strings to our language files and would like other developers to add to them before our release, editing is very simple and works like below:
    
    $lang['edit'] = 'Edit';
    
This would be the English file and to translate into German all you need to do is change the words at the end so it becomes.
    
    $lang['edit'] = 'bearbeiten'; (Ignore my German I failed it)
    
We know there are lots of strings but are grateful that people what to give up there time to help us with this, if you need any help you can email cyberworks@cyberbyte.com or PM a developer on the Altis Life RPG forums.
### This branch is for user submissions and where pull requests should be done to. All files here are yet to be verified.
All of the old string files have been included but it is advised edits are made to the new English file to avoid missing strings.
